            Hi there,  I‚Äôm Dave Albert.  Currently,  I am the CTO of <a href="https://one15.co">One15</a> we are busy building <a href="https://medit.online">Medit</a>. I used to work for Symantec as a Senior Principal Engineer in Site Reliability Engineering on the Infrastructure team for the Norton business unit in Dublin, Ireland. Originally from a pretty small town in West Virginia in the U.S.A., I moved countries to Ireland about 10 years ago.

            I love all things tech and digital.  I have been in love with computers since I was 9 years old and my dad brought home a Compaq Portable.  I remember placing clear tape over the 5 1/4‚Ä≥ floppy disk to tinker with the code on some of the ‚Äúpublic domain‚Äù games we had to make them easier to win.  Things haven‚Äôt changed too much since then.  I still love programming and Linux SysAdmin tasks in my day job, and pretty much any other tech-related activities or learnings.
            </p>

            <p>
            The reason for this site is I want to discuss some of the technology I use, want to use, or really don‚Äôt want to use. I also hope to improve my writing style.  üòâ

            Thanks for reading!
